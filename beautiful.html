                You're the prettiest girl in the world
                You're the sweetest soul I could wish for
                Want your love in every flavor
                You're the sweetest
                You're the sweetest
                I’ve dreams about you
                Three different times last night
                You are a wish my heart desires
                Can’t get you out of my mind
                You make my days so sweet
                You in it, I’m complete
                May I take your hand?
                Did you save the last dance for me?
                Oh I pray
                The happiest ending is written for you and me
                You're the prettiest girl in the world

                I’ve dreams about you
                Holding your hand so tight
                As our hair growing white
                Might not be good at much, but
                Believe me when I say
                Till the end I’ll stay
                May i take your hand?
